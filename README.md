# GameOfLife
This small project was a challenge to re-create the famous 'Game of Life' by John Conway. It is written in Javascript using the p5.js library, and the implementation is based off of 'The Coding Train' on youtube

HOW TO RUN: download the code in a ZIP, unzip the folder and open the index.html file. Have fun!
